In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that doesn't exist can cause unexpected behavior.  For example, if you have a route like `/users/:id` and try to navigate to `/users/123` when no user with id 123 exists, the component might render with incorrect data or no data at all.  This is often because the component fetches data based on the :id parameter and handles no data gracefully.
